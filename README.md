 This is our submission for COMPSCI715. It aims to answer the following research question:
> "How effective are different path-first PCG methodologies for 3D Platformer level design?"

It answers this question through an implementation of the Rhythm-Based path-first PCG technique in a simple 3D platformer game. It also uses Manual generation of levels to effectively evaluate any tangible differences.

## Instructions

To open this project in Unity:
1. Run `MainMenu.unity`.
2. Use an evaluation key from the following:

 | Key      | L1 | L2 | L3 |
 |----------|----|----|----|
 | MSwyLDM= | S  | R  | M  |
 | MywxLDI= | M  | S  | R  |
 | MiwzLDE= | R  | M  | S  |
 | MSwzLDI= | S  | M  | R  |
 | MywyLDE= | M  | R  | S  |
 | MiwxLDM= | R  | S  | M  |

_*Note that S = Swing, R = Random, M = Manual_
